# Image-to-sketch
This project applies a pencil sketch effect to an image using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy, OpenCV, ImageIO, and SciPy. The script converts a given image to grayscale, inverts it, applies a Gaussian blur, and finally blends it with the original grayscale image using the dodge blend technique creating a hand-drawn sketch effect.
